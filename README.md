# SurvAIval - AI Ecosystem Simulation

An intelligent ecosystem simulation where AI agents learn to survive, hunt, and adapt in a dynamic 2D environment.

## Project Overview

SurvAIval is a multi-agent artificial intelligence simulation built from scratch using Python and Pygame. The project demonstrates advanced AI concepts including reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and emergent behavior in a survival ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent AI System**: Different animal species with unique behaviors
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Agents learn and adapt their strategies over time
- **Dynamic Ecosystem**: Procedurally generated environments with limited resources
- **Emergent Behavior**: Complex interactions between predators and prey
- **Real-time Simulation**: 60 FPS interactive ecosystem visualization

## Animal Species

- **Rabbits**: Herbivores that learn optimal foraging and escape strategies
- *(More species coming soon...)* Like deers, wolves, bears...

## AI Technologies

- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**: Each species develops unique survival strategies
- **Q-Learning & Deep Q-Networks**: Advanced decision making algorithms
- **Behavioral AI**: State machines and behavior trees for realistic animal actions
